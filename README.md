# MiwokApp
Miwok Android app, which can be used to learn Miwok language with respect to it's English counterparts. It shows four different activities and uses audio to pronounce the words in Miwok language.


What I learned new by creating this app:

a) To create a custom ArrayAdapter

b) Use of AudioManager Class

c) Right structure and way to handle audio(i.e. audio focus) while using MediaPlayer class



I learned it while doing a course on UDACITY and i do not own the app. It is a sole property of UDACITY and I intend to learn by creating an application.
